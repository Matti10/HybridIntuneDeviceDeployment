.SYNOPSIS
A PowerShell function to retrieve all build tickets that are in a pending status.

.DESCRIPTION
The `Get-PendingBuildTickets` function fetches pending build tickets by utilizing the `Get-FreshTickets` function to get all tickets and then filtering out the build tickets using `Select-ValidBuildTickets` function. Each build ticket is then processed, conversations associated with it are fetched using `Get-FreshTicketConversations` and checked using `Test-DeviceTicketCheckIn`. Tickets which pass through these checks are considered pending tickets and information related to those is recorded.

.PARAMETER buildTicketStatusFilter
The filter criteria to be applied to build tickets.
Default value is `$DeviceDeploymentDefaultConfig.TicketInteraction.ticketWaitingOnBuildFreshFilter`.

.EXAMPLE

Get-PendingBuildTickets

This will execute the function with the default build ticket status filter.

.OUTPUTS

Returns a collection of pending build tickets with associated building information and conversations.

.NOTES

- This function interacts with FreshTickets, a hypothetical tool for ticket handling (an assumption made based on function names like `Get-FreshTickets` and `Get-FreshTicketConversations`). If there are issues during the execution, it catches the exceptions, records them in a list, and writes out at the end of the execution, if any.
- We assumed function and variable names, for example, `Select-ValidBuildTickets`, `Get-FreshTicketConversations`, `Test-DeviceTicketCheckIn`, `$DeviceDeploymentDefaultConfig` based on recognized PowerShell naming conventions. Actual function behavior might differ based on function definition.
